# 🔁 IPHopper

**IPHopper** is an advanced IP rotation tool designed for ethical hackers, privacy enthusiasts, and cybersecurity learners.  
It works by launching multiple Tor nodes in parallel and routing traffic through a centralized Privoxy proxy server — enabling users to automatically change their public IP address at customizable intervals.

Whether you're conducting anonymous security research or learning how anonymization networks like Tor work, IPHopper provides a lightweight and powerful CLI-based solution — especially built for **Termux** and **Linux-based systems**.

## 🎯 Purpose of IPHopper

When working in the cybersecurity field or doing web reconnaissance, constantly changing your IP address can help avoid detection, rate-limiting, and geo-restrictions.  
Most users rely on VPNs, but VPNs are centralized services and not always transparent. Tor, on the other hand, offers a decentralized and free solution for anonymity.

**IPHopper** combines:
- Multiple Tor instances (multi-node parallelization)
- A central Privoxy proxy server
- IP rotation automation via control ports

All packaged in a simple tool with beginner-friendly configuration and advanced functionality under the hood.

## ⚙️ How IPHopper Works

1. **Five separate Tor nodes** are launched with their own config files and data directories.
2. A **Privoxy proxy** is set up and configured to forward all traffic across the 5 Tor nodes.
3. A control loop sends **SIGNAL NEWNYM** to all control ports every X seconds (your interval).
4. Your current **public IP** is fetched and displayed from `https://api64.ipify.org`.
5. Your **IP changes automatically**, as if you're hopping across networks — hence the name *IPHopper*.
